Strong typed actor based and functional programming language

# Introduction

TODO

# Basic Concepts

## Traits

``` 
trait Functor[m:type->type][a:type] {
  map [b:type] (a -> b) -> m b
}

trait Applicative[m:type->type][a:type] with Functor m a {
  (<*>) [b:type] m (a -> b) -> m b
}

trait Monad[m:type->type][a:type] with Applicative m a {
  flatmap [b:type] (a -> m b) -> m b
}
```

## Data

```
data Option[a:type] : type
data None[a:type] : Option a
data Some[a:type](v:a) : Option a
```

## Trait implementation

```
define Functor Option a for Option when None {
  map _ = None
}

define Functor Option a for Option when Some {
  map f = Some (f v)
}

define Applicative Option a for Option a {
  (<*>) None     = None
  (<*>) (Some f) = self map f
}

define Monad Option a for Option a when None {
  flatmap _ = None
}

define Monad Option a for Option a when Some {
  flatmap f = f v
}
```
